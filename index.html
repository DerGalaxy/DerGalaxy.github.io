                I am a recent PhD graduate from the <a href="https://www.math.toronto.edu/cms/">Department of Mathematics</a> at the 
                <a href="https://www.utoronto.ca">University of Toronto</a>, supervised by 
                <a href="https://www.math.toronto.edu/sigal/">Professor Israel Michael Sigal</a>.
                <!-- I completed my undergraduate degree in mathematics and physics, 
                    and my master's in mathematics, also at the University of Toronto. -->
            </p>
            
            <p>My resume is available <a href="./resources/SGherghe_resume_4Sep2024.pdf">here</a>.</p>
            
            <p>I have a growing interest in mathematical finance and data science. <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.07134">Here</a> is a project I did with a colleague in mathematical finance, in which we investigated the ability of a certain mathematical construct (coming from optimal transport) to predict stock market crashes.</p>
            
            <p>
                My academic interests are mainly in the theory of mathematical quantum mechanics and quantum chemistry (also more generally interested in applied PDE theory and spectral theory). I have a few preprints in preparation for publication. Here are some more things I worked on.
                <ul>
                  <li>A project that I did for my <a href="./resources/Existence and Stability HP System_Sebastian.pdf">MSc</a>,</li>
                  <li>Another project I did during my PhD <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.04640">here</a>.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

                <p>
                   Some of my hobbies include sports (soccer, rock climbing, weight-lifting) and dancing salsa.
